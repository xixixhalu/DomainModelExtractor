as a driver, i can check into/select a location through my mobile phone so that the i can pay for my valet.
as a valet company, i can accept mobile payments so that i can offer an easier payment option (meaning through credit card).

as a driver, i can create my profile(first name, last name, email, optional credit card) so that i can use it for all snapvalet-related activities.

the application shall be secure.
- channel is encrypted. (ssl)
- credit card number/password is not stored in plain text on app.
as a customer, i can enter my ticket number from the valet ticket so that i can request my car now/later.
the budget for the project shall not exceed $10,000.
the system shall be capable of eventually running an ios client.

the system should be designed to work on multiple servers in the future and should be capable of handling around 100 requests at the same time.
the system must be available almost all the time, especially during heavy usage hours.
code will be modular so that defects can be isolated and additions can be made easily so that in future it can be maintained by a snapvalet employee.
