as an ess, i can use navigation d&d modules to make the irobot go forward, backward, turn left and right.
as an ess, i can use sensing d&d module to detect cliffs/edges, speed,  direction and elapsed time.
as an ess, i can drag & drop the musical notes from the sounds & light module so that i can create a song.
as an ess, i can use the sounds & light module so that i can turn the leds on and off.
as an ess, i can drag and drop if-then-else and for/while construct in which i can further drag and drop the instructions/loop constructs.
as an ess, i can drag and drop a wait condition  in which i can further drag and drop the instructions/loop constructs.
the system shall detect and show logic errors (conflicting/inconsistent instructions) in an easy-to-read way.
the system shall be a native windows 7 and above application.
the system shall generate instructions for irobot in c which is then later compiled for deployment on the microcontroller using the APIs of irobot.
the system shall enforce a tolerance limit  of +/- 2 to 3% on sensor programmability.
as an ess, i can drag and drop the built-in functions of the irobot to control its behavior/movement.
as an ess, i can copy & paste instructions so that i do not have to re-program.
as an ess, i can create, save and load program files.
