the pipeline shall accept a set of images as an input.
as a system, i can provide an ui for users to view images.
the pipeline shall be controlled directly to administrator.
the pipeline provides additional functionality to the end user of the system.
the pipeline utilizes the provided machine learning algorithms.
the ui is user friendly, clean, and efficient.
the pipeline shall send text and image to the user when correct image has been found.
the pipeline shall use detector model to detect the images uploaded by the users.
the pipeline shall store a model for image classification.
the pipeline shall pre-process training images.
as a user, i can choose one tag that i want to detect in my images.
the pipeline shall use deep learning algorithm.
as a user, i can upload multiple images(each with a label to choose) at the same time.
the pipeline shall handle the image with noise.
the pipeline shall get the images from the facebook via facebook api.
as a client i can upload an image to the pipeline and see a text <classification> along with the initial image.
as a client i can re train the pipeline by giving a new topic and a new set of images.
as a client i can run the entire system in my own unix based server.
as a client i can replace the machine learning algorithm used for training the model without a major pipeline refactor.
as a client i can extract and replace the resulting model after the trainning phase is complete.
