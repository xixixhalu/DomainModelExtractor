The pipeline shall accept a set of image as an input 
As a system I can provide an UI for user to view image 
The pipeline shall be controlled directly to administrator 
The pipeline provides additional functionality to the end user of the system 
The pipeline utilizes the provided machine learning algorithm 
The UI is user friendly clean and efficient 
The pipeline shall send text and image to the user when correct image has been found 
The pipeline shall use detector model to detect the image uploaded by the user 
The pipeline shall store a model for image classification 
The pipeline shall training image 
As a user I can choose one tag that I want to detect in my image 
The pipeline shall use deep learning algorithm 
As a user I can upload multiple image each with a label to choose at the same time 
The pipeline shall handle the image with noise 
The pipeline shall get the image from the Facebook via Facebook API 
As a client I can upload an image to the pipeline and see a text along with the initial image 
As a client I can re train the pipeline by giving a new topic and a new set of image 
As a client I can run the entire system in my own unix based server 
As a client I can replace the machine learning algorithm used for training the model without a major pipeline refactor 
As a client I can extract and replace the resulting model after the trainning phase is complete
