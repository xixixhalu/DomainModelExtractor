The FinalProduct shall be modular and integrate easily into the RestOfFieldProgress ` sTechStack .
The FinalProduct shall accept as InputDistricts/precinctsOfAnySize .
The FinalProduct shall consider District/precinctTopography ( Hills , Freeways , etc. ) when calculating the most OptimalRoute for Volunteers to take .
The FinalProduct shall render an OptionalMap with Voters placed as Points , and Line ( s ) indicating the best Route ( s ) for the Volunteers to take , representing the GroupingOfVoters using Colors .
The FinalProduct shall accept as Input a VariableNumberOfVolunteers .
The FinalProduct shall accept as Input a VariableTimeRange for Volunteers to Canvass ( e.g. 2 Hours ) .
User should be able to InputVoterData into the System and be able to see it in Map .
The FinalProduct shall be executable on Windows , Linux , and Macos operating Systems .
The FinalProduct should have Comments describing each MajorFunction and Class in the Code .
The FinalProduct shall fail gracefully on Error with a StatusCodeOf0 .
The Project should have a well documented ProjectPlan through out the DevelopmentCycle , so the WholeTeam knows what needs to be done and when ( This would help streamline the Project ) .
Success CriticalStakeholders should be able to effectively track the ProjectProgress through VersionControlSystems like Github .
Given VoterDataAndAvailabilityOfVolunteers , we should be able to work on a FeasibleAlgorithm which automatically cuts the Turfs .
It should Implement an EfficientClusteringAlgorithm that Scales , seeing as this will be the MainCoreOfTheProject .
Develop an AccurateAlgorithm for TurfCutting .
A Tool where we can load a VoterList , and it produces clustered VoterList .
We can specify # volunteers , Time per Volunteer , Time per Conversation , and LikelihoodOfConversation as Parameters .
A TestFramework for Objectively verifying its Effectiveness .
