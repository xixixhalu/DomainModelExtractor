Webcrawler must be able to visit public Site , extract simple structured relational Data , generate PostgreSQLINSERTStatement on a configurable Schedule , and check for Conflict within the existing SQLDB .
The Crawler must be able to perform the above Function for all common Form of relational Data
If there is no Data existing for the unique Identifier for the Row within the Table , execute the InsertStatement for the Dataset .
If there is a Conflict the Application must be able to generate and execute a PostgreSQLUPDATEStatement for the `` crawled '' Dataset .
WebcrawlerApp must function in a persistent Manner - if we set it using the above Gui , it should run without Intervention if there are no Error .
The System must be able to function on a major open-source Os .
The Crawler should be able identify and ingest into a HadoopDataStore , unstructured Data , on a configurable Schedule , and check for Conflict within the existing DataStore .
The Crawler should be able identify and ingest into a HiveDataStore , unstructured Data , on a configurable Schedule , and check for Conflict within the existing DataStore .
The Crawler should be able identify and ingest into a PigNoSQLDataStore , unstructured Data , on a configurable Schedule , and check Check for Conflict within the existing DataStore .
All WebcrawlerFunctionality from the relational DataBaseIngest should be mirrored for unstructured DataIngest . .
The Crawler shall self correct simple Error it encounters during the SQLIngestProcess .
The Crawler should have some kind of VisualizationTool which allows Engineer to view a Snapshot of the Interaction between the Crawler , Datasource and STBI Database .
The Crawler should search for new Datasource automatically .
There should be a Portal that allows the User to drag and drop Information in many different Format and then the Crawler should organize , sort and identify the Datatype and then ingest into the PostgreSQLDB .
This would remove most of the Work that a Human would have to do to interact with the Data before it is ready to be analyzed and visualized .
The System shall have two portals . One would be for the SporTechB.IContractor and would have many more advanced Feature and Control . The Second would be a simple , web-based , customer-facing Portal so that the Customer could ingest their Data `` self-service '' and see the Impact in their App immediately .
