The Project should have a well documented ProjectPlan through out the DevelopmentCycle , so the whole Team knows what needs to be done and when .
Success critical Stakeholders should be able to effectively track the ProjectProgress through VersionControlSystems like Github .
Given VoterData and Availability of Volunteers , we should be able to work on a feasible Algorithm which automatically cuts the Turfs .
It should Implement an efficient clustering Algorithm that Scales , seeing as this will be the main Core of the Project .
Develop an accurate Algorithm for TurfCutting .
A Tool where we can load a VoterList , and it produces clustered VoterList .
We can specify # volunteers , Time per Volunteer , Time per Conversation , and Likelihood of Conversation as Parameters .
A TestFramework for Objectively verifying its Effectiveness .
